Version 2.0 of my MLB Game Prediction model
------------------------------------

This began as my final project for CS50 and has evolved into a research project I'm currently writing a paper on.
V1.0 had a maximum accuracy of 57.2%, compared to student averages of 55-56% with a logistic regression model.
Target accuracy is up to 59-60%, bringing in data from the past decade worth of seasons.
